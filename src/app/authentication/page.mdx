# Authentication

The user needs to authenticate thier requests to access some of the endpoints in the LetsGo API. In this guide, we'll look at how authentication works. LetsGo offers a way authenticate API requests: Basic authentication with a JWT token. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Basic authentication

With basic authentication, the user uses the JWT token to authenticate your HTTP requests. JWT tokens are obtainable by logging in to the API at "/users/login". Here's how to authenticate using cURL:

```bash {{ title: 'Example request with basic auth' }}
curl -G https://lets-go-phi.vercel.app/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
```
