# Errors

In this guide, we will talk about what happens when something goes wrong while you work with the API. Mistakes happen, and mostly they will be the users, not API's. Let's look at some status codes and error types you might encounter. {{ className: 'lead' }}

The user can tell their your request was successful by checking the status code when receiving an API response. If a response comes back unsuccessful, the user can use the error type and error message to figure out what has gone wrong and do some rudimentary debugging.

<Note>
  Before freaking out with an error, please be aware that 72% of all
  reported errors are, in fact, user errors. Therefore, please carefully check
  if everything is in order with the request.
</Note>

## Status codes

Here is a list of the different categories of status codes returned by the LetsGo API. Use these to understand if a request was successful.

<Properties>
  <Property name="2xx">
    A 2xx status code indicates a successful response.
  </Property>
  <Property name="4xx">
    A 4xx status code indicates a client error — this means it's a _user_
    problem.
  </Property>
  <Property name="5xx">
    A 5xx status code indicates a server error — the user won't be seeing these `hopefully`.
  </Property>
</Properties>

## Error types

<Row>
  <Col>

    Whenever a request is unsuccessful, the LetsGo API will return an error response. The user can use this information to understand better what has gone wrong and how to fix it. Most of the error messages are pretty helpful and actionable.

    Here is a list of the two error types supported by the LetsGo API — use these to understand what the user has done wrong.

    <Properties>
      <Property name="401 Unathorized">
        This means that the user cannot acces this information, for example: a user cannot acces admin actions.
      </Property>
      <Property name="400 Bad Request">
        This means that the user has made an error with the request, in this example, the admin did not provide an image for the request resulting in a `Zod` error.
      </Property>
    </Properties>

  </Col>
  <Col>

    ```bash {{ title: "401 Unathorized" }}
    {
      "error": "Access denied, no token given"
}
    ```

      <CodeGroup title="400 Bad Request" tag="POST" label="/orders">

       ```bash {{ title: 'Request' }}
      {
         "name": "Bad request example",
         "price": 400,
         "description": "some description",
         "category": "Star Wars",
}
    ```

    ```json {{ title: 'Response' }}
   [
      {
        "code": "invalid_type",
        "expected": "string",
        "received": "undefined",
        "path": [
